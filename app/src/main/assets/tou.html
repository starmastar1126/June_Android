    <p>Welcome to CaymanAll!<br /> CaymanAll and its associates provide their services to you subject to the following conditions. Please read them carefully.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</strong><br /> When you visit CaymanAll or send e-mails to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by e-mail or by posting notices on this App. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>COPYRIGHT</strong><br /> All content included on this App, such as text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations, and software, is the property of CaymanAll or its content suppliers and protected by international copyright laws. The compilation of all content on this App is the exclusive property of CaymanAll, with copyright authorship for this collection by CaymanAll, and protected by international copyright laws.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>TRADE MARKS</strong><br /> CaymanAll trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not CaymanAll, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that disparages or discredits CaymanAll. All other trademarks not owned by CaymanAll or its subsidiaries that appear on this App are the property of their respective owners, who may or may not be affiliated with, connected to, or sponsored by CaymanAll or its subsidiaries.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>LICENSE AND APP ACCESS</strong><br /> CaymanAll grants you a limited license to access and make personal use of this app and not to download (other than page caching) or modify it, or any portion of it, except with express written consent of CaymanAll. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of this App or its contents: any collection and use of any product listings, descriptions, or prices: any derivative use of this App or its contents: any downloading or copying of account information for the benefit of another merchant: or any use of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools. This App or any portion of this App may not be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, viAppd, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without express written consent of CaymanAll. You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of CaymanAll and our associates without express written consent. You may not use any meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing CaymanAll name or trademarks without the express written consent of CaymanAll. Any unauthorized use terminates the permission or license granted by CaymanAll. You are granted a limited, revocable, and nonexclusive right to create a hyperlink to the home page of CaymanAll so long as the link does not portray CaymanAll, its associates, or their products or services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter. You may not use any CaymanAll logo or other proprietary graphic or trademark as part of the link without express written permission.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>YOUR MEMBERSHIP ACCOUNT</strong>&nbsp;If you use this app, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your device, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. If you are under 18, you may use our app only with involvement of a parent or guardian. CaymanAll and its associates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in their sole discretion.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>REVIEWS, COMMENTS, EMAILS, AND OTHER CONTENT</strong><br /> Visitors may post reviews, comments, and other content: and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam." You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. CaymanAll reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content. If you do post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant CaymanAll and its associates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You grant CaymanAll and its associates and sub-licensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such content, if they choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post: that the content is accurate: that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity: and that you will indemnify CaymanAll or its associates for all claims resulting from content you supply. CaymanAll has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or content. CaymanAll takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>RISK OF LOSS</strong><br /> All items purchased from CaymanAll are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This basically means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</strong><br /> CaymanAll and its associates attempt to be as accurate as possible. However, CaymanAll does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of this app is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by CaymanAll itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY THIS APP IS PROVIDED BY CAYMANALL ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.

Arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrators award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>APP POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY</strong><br /> Please review our other policies, such as our Shipping and Returns policy, posted on this App. These policies also govern your visit to CaymanAll. We reserve the right to make changes to our App, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>QUESTIONS:</strong><br /> Questions regarding our Conditions of Usage, Privacy Policy, or other policy related material can be directed to our support staff by clicking on the "Contact Us" link in the side menu.

    <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.<br /> We may collect Personal Information from you such as email address, phone number or mailing address when you choose to request information about our Services, register for CaymanAll newsletter or a program that we may offer from time to time, request to receive customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.<br /> In some cases we may collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or by accessing your mobile device&rsquo;s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.<br /> <br /> <strong>We will not share any Personal Information that we have collected from or regarding you with any third-party company or business partner.</strong>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>MODIFYING YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br /> You can access and modify the Personal Information associated with your Account through your Account settings or by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@CaymanAll.com"><strong>support@CaymanAll.com</strong></a>.<br /> If you want us to delete your Personal Information and your Account, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@yourdomain.com"><strong>support@CaymanAll.com</strong></a>with your request. We&rsquo;ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIVICATION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION</strong><br /> You may inquire as to whether CaymanAll is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@CaymanAll.com"><strong>support@CaymanAll.com</strong></a>&nbsp;to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by us. Please include your full name, email address associated with your Account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Although CaymanAll makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others&rsquo; privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual&rsquo;s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br /> We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your Personal Information) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.<br /> By using the App/App or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the App. If we learn of a security system&rsquo;s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the app or sending an e-mail to you. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>OUR POLICY TOWARD CHILDREN</strong><br /> Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible. If you are under the age of 18, you must have your parent&rsquo;s permission to access the Services.&nbsp;<br /> </p>
